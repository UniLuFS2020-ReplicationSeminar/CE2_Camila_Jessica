### Research Question

Does the sentiment of mental health articles vary significantly between different authors?

### Hypothesis

We hypothesize that there will be a significant difference in sentiment scores among authors contributing to mental health articles.

### Data Collection

We collected articles related to mental health using the Guardian API, extracting fields such as title, body, and author.

### Data Prep

The text data was processed to lowercase, remove punctuation and digits.

### Tokenization 
The text was tokenized into individual words, and stop words were removed. We plot the results:

**The most frequent words per author:**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Applications/Working_Directory/IHRS/ihrs-hypothesis/CE2_Camila_Jessica/Figures/word_freq_author.png")
```

**The word most frequent per author:**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Applications/Working_Directory/IHRS/ihrs-hypothesis/CE2_Camila_Jessica/Figures/word_freq_author2.png")
```

We also use Wordcloud to provide us a image of the most frequent words overall:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Applications/Working_Directory/IHRS/ihrs-hypothesis/CE2_Camila_Jessica/Figures/Wordcloud.png")
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
