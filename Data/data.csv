"2","Family calls for Essex mental health inquiry to include mother’s death","<p>A man whose mother killed herself after going three months without an NHS psychiatric appointment has said it is wrong that a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/28/inquiry-mental-health-deaths-essex-nhs-trusts-given-legal-powers"">public inquiry</a> will not investigate her death and others like hers.</p> <p>The Lampard inquiry is looking into the deaths of almost 2,000 mental health patients in Essex since 2000 but Andrea Waddington’s will not be included because it occurred in February, after the inquiry’s chosen cut-off date of the end of last year. Additionally, Waddington, who was 59 when she died, does not qualify because she was being treated in the community.</p> <p>Her son James, 29, said the exclusion did not make sense. “The experience of an outpatient is just as bad if not worse,” he said. “And although she passed [away] outside of the period, obviously the difficulties in her treatment journey were within the last year, so it’s still in the period.”</p> <p>He also said he had been told there were no beds available even if she were to have been sectioned.</p> <p>James said his mother was sectioned in 2012, put on an antidepressant and was well until the beginning of last year when her own mother fell ill. He said her mental health went downhill after a doctor responded by changing her medication, and the type and dose changed frequently over the next few months.</p> <p>When she began having suicidal thoughts, a mental health crisis team started to make visits but then stopped, he said. James estimated that his mother had five psychiatrist appointments in a year, three of which were by phone.</p> <p>In October last year a psychiatrist told Waddington they were leaving the area, and the next appointment, which was on the phone, was not until 2 February, when another psychiatrist said they too were leaving, James said. Two days later his father found her dead in the loft.</p> <p>“You’ve got a three-month window where you’ve had no help from the NHS and yet her thoughts were still the same,” James said. “During that period of October to February, there was no one involved. The mental health team could have stepped in and said ‘OK, because you haven’t got a psychiatrist, we’ll resume the visits’. There was basically nothing – just a void.</p> <p>“If I put myself in my mum’s mind, she’s been waiting all that time, you finally have a call and the person basically just tells you that [they’re leaving].”</p> <p>He said that before his mother became unwell last year she was “really bubbly”, and she enjoyed gardening, yoga and playing the piano. “I would have expected another 30 years with her,” he said.</p> <p>Priya Singh, a senior associate at Hodge Jones &amp; Allen who is representing the family, said there were many others in the same boat. “They have valuable evidence to share and the [inquiry] chair needs to give urgent consideration to the position regarding such families,” she said.</p> <p>Ann Sheridan, an executive nurse at Essex Partnership University NHS foundation trust, said their thoughts were with the Waddingtons and “we are constantly striving to improve care that we offer those with often complex needs. We will of course take onboard any recommendations from a future inquest.”</p> <p>An inquiry spokesperson said that “unfortunately” there was a “necessity for an end date”, and that including all community care “would significantly broaden the scope beyond the inquiry’s core purpose of examining inpatient deaths”.</p> <p>Expressing sympathy for his mother’s death, they added: “We would urge Mr Waddington (and anyone impacted) to contact the inquiry, either himself or through his legal representatives.”</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the UK and Ireland, <a href=""https://www.samaritans.org/"">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email <a href=""mailto:jo@samaritans.org"">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=""mailto:jo@samaritans.ie"">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

"3","Mental health advance choice documents ‘would reduce sectioning’","<p>Fewer people with mental illnesses would endure the trauma of being sectioned if advance choice documents – setting out a treatment plan while they are well – were included in Mental Health Act reforms, a leading psychiatrist has said.</p> <p>Advance choice documents are the only proven way to reduce the number of people detained under the Mental Health Act in England and Wales, which is one of the reforms’ core objectives, said Dr Lade Smith, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6582216/"">Research</a> suggests that the use of these documents can reduce compulsory detention rates in psychiatric units, often known as sectioning, by 25%, minimising traumatic experiences for people with bipolar, schizophrenia and other psychotic illnesses.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/07/childrens-emergency-mental-health-referrals-in-england-soar-by-53"">Children’s emergency mental health referrals in England soar by 53%</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It’s high time there was reform of the Mental Health Act because the rates of detention are increasing, especially for marginalised groups, those who are poor or from a minoritised ethnic community, especially black Caribbean … Advance choice docs were a recommendation of the review, I don’t know why they haven’t gone through,” said Smith.</p> <p>Advance choice documents are especially effective in reducing the significantly higher detention rates for black people with mental illnesses, as they can help patients feel more autonomous and reduce unconscious bias.</p> <p>The documents can also speed up and improve recovery, and reduce the time spent in hospital, which can have a negative impact on patients’ jobs, homes or relationships, said Smith.</p> <p>Advance choice documents are similar to those used in palliative care. Patients work with a healthcare professional when they are well to outline the signs that they are experiencing a manic or psychotic episode, effective treatments, and their personal preferences.</p> <p>This could include background information and trigger questions to help healthcare practitioners establish delusional thought patterns; medications and doses which have been effective previously; and requests to be put in hospital for their own safety, or – more unusually – that of others.</p> <p>Although the documents are now included in NHS guidance, take-up remains low, due to limited awareness, logistical challenges and a misconception that patients may ask for ineffective treatments, such as Reiki healing, said Smith.</p> <p>“Ideally, there should be a mandatory requirement of services to offer advance choice documents to anybody who’s ever been detained under the Mental Health Act – that’s what we’d like to see,” she said.</p> <p>King’s College London is aiming to boost awareness with a <a href=""https://www.advancechoice.org/"">new site</a>, which will be used as a resource on the NHS to spur a culture shift towards shared decision-making.</p> <p>Dr Tania Gergel, a researcher at UCL who is leading on the Advance Choice project, said this would represent a move away from the “paternalistic” model of psychiatry, reflecting that “people have a very good understanding of their illness”.</p> <p>In interviews for the project, she found examples where clinicians refused to follow the advance choice document. One patient had written that an antipsychotic worked for them at a lower dose, while the usual prescribed dose made them physically unwell, but this was ignored and recovery was only achieved through a traumatic process of trial and error after being sectioned.</p> <p>Others said they hated being injected, which is common in forcible detentions, including in their buttocks while being held down in the middle of a ward. “People can feel that who they are as a person becomes completely erased,” said Gergel.</p> <p>Gergel, who has bipolar, believes that advance choice documents have saved her life, as she experiences severe mixed manic and psychotic episodes in which she quickly becomes uncontrollably suicidal. She has struggled to stay safe as she is good at concealing her symptoms.</p> <p>Her document contains trigger questions to help doctors tease out her delusions, and includes a “self-binding” agreement, meaning that when these symptoms are present she needs to be treated and supervised immediately for her own safety. It adds that conventional medications have not worked for her and that she needs electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) – this helped doctors secure hospital approval to give it to her during pregnancy, a treatment typically avoided despite no evidence of harm to the baby.</p> <p>She said the document helps her understand intellectually why it’s important to stay in hospital, even if she feels a desire to abscond.</p> <p>Since writing it, she said her episodes have been “much calmer”. “It has really worked, and has meant I’ve stayed safe although I’ve been deeply suicidal. When I reflect afterwards, no matter how difficult the episode has been, the trauma is nothing compared to when it was formal detention and literally being held down.”</p> <p>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the draft mental health bill did not include provisions for a statutory advance choice document because “it is important that a person can make advance choices in a way that best meets their needs, which may not always be in a written document”. Instead, the draft bill gives advance choices the same legal weight without requiring a statutory document.</p> <p>• In the UK and Ireland, <a href=""https://www.samaritans.org/"">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email <a href=""mailto:jo@samaritans.org"">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=""mailto:jo@samaritans.ie"">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

"4","Teachers’ mental health ‘crisis’ prompts call for suicide prevention strategy","<p>All school leaders should receive suicide prevention training to help tackle a “mental health emergency” among teachers, under a plan unanimously backed by a vote by union members.</p> <p>A workforce survey of members of the NASUWT teaching union found that some teachers had been driven to the point of suicide by the stress of the job.</p> <p>Among 12,000 responses, 23% reported drinking more alcohol, 12% the use of or increased use of antidepressants, and 3% said they had self-harmed as a result of their work.</p> <p>The results and emotional testimony from delegates about colleagues who had taken their own lives or planned to do so prompted members to back a suicide prevention strategy for teachers at the union’s annual conference in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, on Sunday.</p> <p>It urged the union’s executive to campaign for staff trained in mental health first aid in all schools and colleges, and fully funded mandatory mental health training.</p> <p>The primary school headteacher Ruth Perry killed herself while awaiting the outcome of an Ofsted report. There have been reports of at least <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/22/work-related-suicides-should-investigated-watchdog-unions-say"">eight other teacher suicides linked to Ofsted reports.</a></p> <p>The proposer of the motion, Row Martin, listed a number of teachers who had taken their own lives in recent years, including Perry. “We cannot afford to lose any more teachers,” she said. Delegate Kuldip Hoonjan from Leicestershire told the conference that two of her teacher friends had taken their lives.</p> <p>The unanimously carried motion warned of a “rise in suicide, suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts” among teachers, and said the union was concerned the number “will only increase”.</p> <p>One teacher from Fife told the conference she had had suicidal thoughts after starting at a school with challenging pupil behaviour. “I’ve been in a very dark place in these last few months, to the point where I have repeatedly thought of suicide,” she said. “I have also thought about leaving a career of 20 years.”</p> <p>Delegate Karen Brocklebank said the “stresses of rigorous classroom inspections, government targets, unmanageable amounts of paperwork and 50-hour-plus working weeks” had caused an increase in suicide rates and serious mental health problems among school staff.</p> <p>Another delegate, Claire Ward, spoke of a colleague who had confided in her that they planned to kill themselves. “I was shaking,” she said. “I couldn’t think of anything other than what had happened for days. It woke me up for weeks on and off.”</p> <p>Richard Kempa, a delegate from Northamptonshire, said: “Mental health is in crisis in our profession. It is a crisis. There’s no getting away from it.”</p> <p>A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We recognise the extraordinary work that headteachers, teachers and other staff in schools provide, and we take their wellbeing very seriously.”</p> <p><em>In the UK and Ireland, <a href=""https://www.samaritans.org/"">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email <a href=""mailto:jo@samaritans.org"">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=""mailto:jo@samaritans.ie"">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

"5","How Covid lockdowns hit mental health of teenage boys hardest","<p>Teenage boys were hit hardest by the Covid lockdowns, with their mental health failing to recover despite the return to normality, according to the most comprehensive academic study of its kind.</p> <p>Early research into how lockdown affected children indicated that <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/sep/21/mental-health-among-uk-secondary-pupils-worsened-sharply-in-pandemic-study-shows"">girls had suffered more significant mental health problems</a> than boys. </p> <p>However, a new study carried out by academics from three UK universities, published in the journal <em>European </em><em>Child </em><em>+ Adolescent Psychiatry</em>, found that over the long term, teenage boys’ mental health was more adversely affected.</p> <p>The research followed a cohort of about 200 children, aged between 11 and 14 at the time, asking them and their mothers to assess their mental state. It logged data from each child before lockdown, three months after the measures started and again at 15 months into the pandemic. </p> <p>Researchers then compared this data with historical records that show the usual pattern of mental wellbeing for boys and girls during adolescence.</p> <p>The academics found that while both sexes had an immediate decline in their mental health, boys then did not experience the natural improvement in mental wellbeing that usually comes with maturation as they move through the teenage years.</p> <p>Dr Nicky Wright, a lecturer in psychology at Manchester Metropolitan University and a co-author of the paper, said: “The key message of this is that we expect more boys to be at risk of mental health problems now than we would before [the pandemic].</p>    <p>“Girls, on average, are more likely to suffer with mental health problems than boys. But the girls in the study followed their usual pattern, suggesting the experience of lockdown had a more significant impact on boys than girls.</p> <p>“There wasn’t a pandemic effect on girls’ depression. When you account for puberty and development, it’s consistent with previous trends,” said Wright.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/21/young-and-old-how-the-covid-pandemic-has-affected-every-uk-generation"">Young and old: how the Covid pandemic has affected every UK generation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This weekend marks four years since the first UK lockdown was called on 23 March 2020. Schools were closed, leaving teenagers who were used to spending at least six hours a day surrounded by peers isolated from society. Work set by teachers for home schooling took an average of between two and three hours a day for most adolescents to complete, and with many parents working, lots of teenagers were left alone for long periods of time.</p> <p>For those who were moving between primary and secondary school during the pandemic years, lockdowns also disrupted integration into new social groups and the chance to form friendships. </p> <p>For older teenagers, universities and colleges switched to virtual lectures and seminars, leaving new students unable to form bonds with others. </p> <p>The psychologist and writer Wendy Gregory said the findings of the study echoed changes to her client list in her private practice. “Lockdown has had a horrific impact on mental health, particularly in boys and young men, and partly I’m seeing the results of this now as I’m getting a lot more seeking therapy,” she said. </p> <p>“There has been a big upturn in males seeking mental health support generally across the age ranges, and for teen boys there has been a huge uptick.”</p> <p>In south London, Dr Jen Wills Lamacq, a child psychologist who works in state schools, said she has seen the pandemic effect on boys’ mental health first-hand, including increased difficult behaviour. She believes the decline in young male mental health was triggered by the rupture to their lives at a crucial point in adolescent development.</p> <p>“Lots of boys, to regulate their emotions, may want to be outside, doing something active and around other people, without necessarily talking. For long periods of time, they were deprived of opportunities to regulate their mental wellbeing in a way that comes naturally to them,” she said.</p> <p>For parents of teenage boys and young men, the findings may come as little surprise. Single mother Rebecca*, from London, says her teenage son, who was already receiving counselling before the pandemic, had a breakdown during lockdown that resulted in him becoming violent and police being called to restrain him.</p> <p>“He was doing his GCSEs and when lockdown happened at first it was a huge relief because he didn’t have to go into school, as that was a trigger for anxiety, but losing that routine was awful and he had a breakdown. He had a psychotic episode where he was hearing voices. The police came and were very hard with him, and they put him in handcuffs in front of me,” she said.</p> <p>Rebecca’s son is now an adult and his health has improved from that crisis point, but she says lockdown has had a lasting impact on his mental wellbeing. “I think it was dreadful. I think there will be repercussions for years to come for all kids,” she said.</p>","Hannah Fearn"
"6","Review of gender services has major implications for mental health services","<p>A long-awaited review by consultant paediatrician Hilary Cass into the NHS’s gender services for children calls for a dramatic shift in the type of treatment offered to children and young people with gender dysphoria.</p> <p>The report proposes that instead of being offered mainly medical treatment, young people referred to NHS gender services should “receive a holistic assessment of their needs to inform an individualised care plan”, meaning that questions of gender identity should be treated alongside other possible mental health concerns.</p> <p>It found that a medical pathway, such as puberty blockers, would not necessarily be the best option for children with gender dysphoria, and should not be provided “without also addressing wider mental health and/or psychosocially challenging problems”. The review suggests this “should include screening for neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism spectrum disorder, and a mental health assessment”.</p> <p>The idea of a holistic assessment has so far been welcomed by medical experts, such as Dr Lade Smith, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, who said: “Children who are gender questioning also commonly experience mental illness. It is extremely important that every child who is gender questioning has timely access to services that are holistic and respond to their individual needs.”</p> <p>But the proposals will have major implications for wider children’s mental health services, which are already overstretched.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/10/mother-criticises-agenda-from-above-cass-report-trans"">Mother criticises ‘agenda from above’ after release of Cass report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The waiting lists for gender-affirming care on the NHS are incredibly long.

It states: “It is only when they have been on very long waiting lists, and sidelined from usual care in local services, that they are forced to do their own research and may come to a single medical answer to their problems.”</p> <p>However, general mental health services for young people are no better.</p> <p>More than a quarter of a million (270,300) children and young people in England are still waiting for mental health support after being referred to children and young people’s mental health services in 2022-23, according to the children’s commissioner.</p> <p>Between July and September of last year, children and young people who had an appointment for suspected autism had waited on average nine months (295 days) after their initial referral. This is despite the National Institute for <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/health"">Health</a> and Care Excellence recommending that people with suspected autism should be diagnosed within three months of a referral.</p> <p>Cass’s report said long waiting lists for gender services were in part due to an “unprecedented” increase in demand in recent years, which created “an unsustainable service model”. “Prior to 2009, Gids (the gender identity development service) did not attract significant attention. At that time, the service saw fewer than 50 children a year, with even fewer receiving medical treatment,” the report states.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/10/what-are-the-key-findings-of-the-nhs-gender-identity-review"">What are the key findings of the NHS gender identity review?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/28/nhs-closing-down-london-gender-identity-clinic-for-children"">closure of the Gids clinic</a> at the Tavistock and Portman NHS foundation trust in London in 2023, NHS England pledged to open eight regional clinics delivering a “different model of care”.

Of course we’re tough on crime and support the police, but we also need to be tough on the complex causes of crime.</p> <p>“We need to make sure that young people in particular get proper medical treatment rather than waiting years and years and in the end having to have a crisis before they get the help they need.”</p> <p>There has been a fall in homicide rates in England and Wales since 2008 yet despite this, <a href=""https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/mental-disorder-in-people-convicted-of-homicide-longterm-national-trends-in-rates-and-court-outcome/54040925495A5C66695E931160CD8117"">research shows</a> that the relative contribution of mental ill-health as a proportion of all homicide has increased.</p> <p>Khan highlighted the case of Barnaby Webber and Grace O’Malley-Kumar, stabbed to death in Nottingham last year by Valdo Calocane, who was given an <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/25/nottingham-attacks-valdo-calocane-to-be-detained-at-high-security-hospital"">indefinite hospital order</a> for manslaughter by diminished responsibility, after he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.</p> <p>“I studied the awful case in Nottingham … and how those families were let down because of the failure of the state to take action against this person who had mental ill-health,” the Labour politician said.</p> <p>“I’m afraid the bad news is that my years of experience tell me that there are too many people who should be receiving medical treatment who aren’t and go on to commit serious acts of violence, sometimes homicide.</p> <p>“It’s perverse in my view that it’s only when they’re in custody that they receive the treatment they should’ve received as outpatients.</p> <p>“I don’t think these crimes are inevitable, I think they’re preventable, just as austerity was a choice made 14 years ago, the consequences we’re living with now.”</p> <p>Khan, who is running for a third term as London mayor, said that if re-elected he would approach mental health as a public health issue, mirroring the national <a href=""https://news.sky.com/story/sir-keir-starmer-promises-mental-health-reforms-under-a-labour-government-as-he-welcomes-tory-defector-13125500"">Labour party’s focus</a> on early intervention.</p> <p>He has <a href=""https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/sadiq-khan-pledges-800000-plug-32530193"">pledged to invest</a> in a pilot scheme with mental first aiders and counsellors in 30 schools across London. NHS data showed 120,000 children waited six months or longer between referral and treatment in 2022-23.</p> <p>“Not all of those are going to go on to commit acts of violence, and not all of those will become criminals. But even if a small fraction are, that’s a big number,” he said.</p> <p>Khan’s Tory rival, Susan Hall, has so far resisted politicising the attack despite knife crime being a key election issue. But former Conservative party chair <a href=""https://x.com/GregHands/status/1785279112816263627"">Greg Hands</a>, a London MP, asked on X: “What has our great capital city come to when a 13-year-old [sic] boy is killed in a sword attack?”</p> <p>The Tottenham Conservative party posted a video of the suspect on X, with the words: “Knife crime has risen 54% in London and is at a five-year high. We can’t go on like this.” The post was later deleted.</p> <p>In response, Khan, who visited Redbridge earlier in the day, said: “Today of all days, I really don’t want to get involved in using this poor boy as a political football.</p> <p>“All I’d say to those who wish to capitalise on this politically is look at the evidence around the country over the last 14 years: police numbers being cut; youth clubs closing down; cost of living crisis increasing.”</p> <p>Knife crime offences in London rose year-on-year to 14,577, according to the latest official figures, up 20% but not yet at levels seen before the Covid-19 pandemic. However, figures also show <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/feb/26/fact-check-has-sadiq-khan-really-overseen-a-surge-in-london"">Londoners are less likely to be a victim of crime</a> than people across the country as a whole.</p> <p>Khan said: “You can’t run away from the fact that crime across the country is far too high. You can pick and choose the numbers you want but it’s a fact that people feel scared.</p> <p>“London’s not the exception, people across the country don’t feel safe. I’m angry that the government has got away with austerity, cuts in the police and youth clubs and the NHS. It was a choice.”</p> <p>Khan has doubled funding to the Metropolitan police to £1.1bn since he came to office in 2016, while government funding to the force was cut by 32%, or £1bn over the same period. He has also invested hundreds of millions of pound in youth clubs, which have seen savage cuts.</p> <p>He denied that a recent joke suggesting that Hall should stop watching gritty US cop series The Wire made light of the situation. “No,” he said. “I’m angry about the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/mar/25/tories-sadiq-khan-attack-ad-new-york-london"">Conservatives choosing pictures</a> from Penn Station in New York in their party political broadcast. I’m proud of the fact that, warts and all, this is the greatest city in the world.”</p> <p>• The headline of this article was amended on 1 May 2024 to better reflect the mayor’s comments.</p>","Pippa Crerar Political editor"
"8","Bereaved families continue to wait for Essex mental health inquiry","<p>Bereaved relatives have accused ministers of dragging their feet over an inquiry into the death of almost 2,000 patients across NHS mental health trusts in Essex.</p> <p>The inquiry has still not started more than eight months after the announcement that it would be <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/28/inquiry-mental-health-deaths-essex-nhs-trusts-given-legal-powers"">relaunched with beefed-up powers</a>.</p> <p>In June last year, the government gave in to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/07/essex-mental-health-inquiry-pointless-without-legal-powers-say-families"">pressure from families</a> and the then chair of the inquiry, granting it legal powers to compel witnesses to give evidence. In December, the new terms of reference were sent to ministers, setting out what the inquiry will investigate.</p> <p>But the terms of reference have yet to be approved by ministers, leaving relatives frustrated, with another “unnecessary” death reported a few weeks ago.</p> <p>Melanie Leahy, whose son, Matthew, died at the Linden Centre in Chelmsford in 2012, said: “I know that this inquiry, the first of its kind nationally, if carried out in a timely and comprehensively investigative manner, it has the power to prevent more deaths, not just in Essex but all over the UK.</p> <p>“Why am I and all the other bereaved families and injured individuals still waiting? Worse, why are we being met with such callous and terrifying indifference? Why are our legal team being ignored? We can only conclude that our government simply does not care. If the government continues to drag its feet in this way then they must be held to account for their failings. If there are more deaths during this interminable wait, this government needs to be held responsible.”</p> <p>The inquiry initially launched on a non-statutory basis in January 2021 to investigate deaths at the Essex partnership university NHS trust and its predecessors between 2000 and 2020. It was established after a 2019 investigation by the parliamentary and health service ombudsman that found numerous failings in the events surrounding the deaths of Matthew Leahy, 20, and another young man named only as Mr R.</p> <p>Priya Singh, a medical negligence senior associate at Hodge Jones &amp; Allen, which is representing scores of families, called the delay “shocking”, saying: “The terms of reference are still waiting to be finalised by the government. Why?</p> <p>“Whilst waiting for meaningful progress, yet another unnecessary death occurred a few weeks ago of a loved one whist under the care of Essex partnership university NHS foundation trust.”</p> <p>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson expressed sympathies to the bereaved families and said it took the investigation extremely seriously. They said: “Baroness [Kate] Lampard has undertaken a consultation of its terms of reference, and this is now being considered.”</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the UK and Ireland, <a href=""https://www.samaritans.org/"">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email <a href=""mailto:jo@samaritans.org"">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=""mailto:jo@samaritans.ie"">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

"9","Professionals know that mental health is complex – and that MDMA won’t help | Letters","<p>Rose Cartwright’s article (<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/13/i-was-the-poster-girl-for-ocd-then-i-began-to-question-everything-id-been-told-about-mental-illness"">I was the poster girl for OCD. Then I began to question everything I’d been told about mental illness, 13 April</a>) claims to expose “the fallacy at the heart of mental healthcare”, arguing that the sector – including but not limited to psychiatrists, occupational therapists, social workers, employment advisers, psychologists, dementia nurses, experts by experience, care home staff, art therapists, carers and support workers – fails to grasp the multifaceted nature of mental health and, instead, reduces it to an illness/treatment model.</p> <p>I was part of a recent multi-disciplinary team meeting. A psychiatrist shared their concern about patients facing homelessness and asked what might be done. To which a support worker replied that funding for the local homelessness organisation – a key resource for such patients – had just been cut. Everyone, including the psychiatrist, slumped in their chair, knowing that homelessness is a potent risk factor for addiction, mental health crises and suicide. Without such organisations, these risks often become a reality.</p> <p>Those who work in mental healthcare are all too aware of the fallacy that is actually at play: that good mental health can be sustained while the wider social infrastructure (housing, training, employment, social care) is obliterated.</p> <p>Yet the idea that mental health professionals are simply hapless lemmings bimbling around a dusty old medical model was not my main issue with this article. My main issue was the suggestion that MDMA may be more helpful than regulated care for mental ill health. I have seen a number of patients sectioned and admitted due to drug-induced psychosis. One of these patients had taken MDMA and, unfortunately, had a young child who had to be taken into care while their parent recovered.</p> <p>The author of the article clearly understands the profound impact this is likely to have had on this child.

"10","Mental health trust failings contributed to Norfolk man’s death, coroner finds","<p>A series of failings by a troubled NHS mental health trust contributed to the death of a former government climate change adviser, a coroner has found.</p> <p>Christopher Sidle, 51, who had a history of psychosis, fatally self-harmed on 1 July last year during a psychotic episode two days after being refused a crisis admission by Norfolk and Suffolk foundation trust (NSFT) despite warnings from his family and a trust psychiatrist, Norfolk coroner’s court heard.</p> <p>Sidle threw himself from a taxi three days after he became acutely psychotic and told his family that “aliens were coming” and that he had “three days left to live”.</p> <p>NSFT’s crisis team was repeatedly warned of this “countdown” by his sister, Dr Katie Sidle, a consultant neurologist, as she pleaded with staff to allow her brother to be admitted to hospital. But her concerns were ignored, the inquest heard.</p> <p>Norfolk’s senior coroner, Jacqueline Lake, highlighted a series of “missed opportunities”, “inadequate assessments” and a lack of mental health beds in the weeks leading up to his death. Lake ruled out suicide and death by misadventure as the state of Sidle’s mind was not revealed by the evidence. He died from head injuries in hospital on 4 July.</p> <p>Following the verdict, Sidle’s family backed calls for a public inquiry into a series of failures at the trust, including its inability to account for <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/21/mental-health-trust-deaths"">8,440 “unexpected” deaths among its patients</a> or those it recently cared for between 2019 and 2022.</p> <p>The last psychiatrist who assessed Sidle, Dr Vassiliki Papachronopoulou, also warned a trust manager she was “extremely concerned” about the trust’s refusal to admit Sidle. But this warning also went unheeded, the inquest heard.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/19/it-might-have-been-different-how-norfolk-and-suffolk-nhs-foundation-trust-is-failing-mental-health-patients""> ‘It might have been different’: how Norfolk and Suffolk NHS foundation trust is failing mental health patients</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On 29 June, Sidle was refused a hospital bed based on the assessment of a newly qualified mental health nurse, acting without supervision for the first time, the inquest heard.</p> <p>The court was read a transcript of a call on Thursday 29 July between Katie Sidle, who specialises in conditions that often present as psychosis, and the nurse, in which she relayed that her brother was “acutely psychotic”, had a history of masking his symptoms, and had told her that morning he now only “two days left to live”.</p> <p>She told the nurse: “Sunday [1 July] will be day zero, I’ve no idea what he will do but I’m worried it will be pretty catastrophic.”</p> <p>But the nurse insisted Sidle was “not psychotic” and refused to reassess him for a crisis mental health bed. Summing up the inquest, Lake noted that the assessment was carried without input from others in mental health team and without Sidle’s notes being read.</p> <p>Lake said: “The assessment was inadequate and was a further missed opportunity to provide appropriate inpatient care to Christopher which more than minimally contributed to his death.”</p> <p>Lake also highlighted other “missed opportunities” including emails between teams not being acted upon and a previous “inadequate” assessment of Sidle on 19 May by another nurse who refused to provide hospital care. During this assessment “psychotic markers were underestimated and/or missed”, Lake said.</p> <p>On the morning of the fatal incident, Katie Sidle again tried to find a hospital bed for her brother. She was told 28 patients were awaiting an acute mental health bed at the time, her evidence submitted to the inquest said.</p> <p>Lake confirmed that she would be publishing two prevention of future deaths reports in the coming weeks. One will address the trusts failings. Lake said: “Training clearly needs to go further. I’m also not convinced that action has been taken to ensure that all emails are picked up promptly and passed to the relevant person.”</p> <p>The other report will be sent to health secretary expressing Lake’s “concerns” about the lack of mental health beds.</p> <p>A family statement, issued through their lawyers, Ashtons Legal, said: “We do not hold the individual clinicians involved in Chris’s care personally accountable for his death – from our perspective, they too are victims of a failing and dangerous system. We know that Chris would echo this opinion.</p> <p>“Chris’s death was entirely avoidable. We expect the trust to take the coroner’s findings seriously. It must follow through with its action plan to address the failings that have been identified.</p> <p>“Until this trust’s systemic, longstanding failures are remedied – which it has failed to do despite having been in and out of special measures for nearly a decade – there will be further avoidable deaths and families left wondering why previous warnings were not heeded.”</p> <p>“There have been calls for a public inquiry into the quality and delivery of mental health services carried out by NSFT, and we as a family support those calls.”</p> <p>Cath Byford, the NSFT deputy chief executive, said: “We have taken action to improve as a trust following Christopher’s sad death. This includes amending our crisis triage tool to collect more detailed information and improved staff training. We have also implemented a ‘Think Family’quality improvement project to capture family and carer knowledge in relation to patient history. This will help us to engage and work with service users, their families, and carers to make the best care decisions to support our patients and identify when further support or intervention is needed.”</p> <p>“We will act on all concerns raised by the coroner and work to ensure further learning and improvements are embedded.”</p> <ul> <li><p>In the UK, the charity <a href=""https://www.mind.org.uk/"">Mind</a> is available on 0300 123 3393.
